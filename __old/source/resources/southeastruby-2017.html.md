**Hello** Southeast Ruby! Thanks for exploring functional Ruby with me! Want to learn more? Here are some resources to get you started.

## Slides

**[Real-world Functional Ruby](https://speakerdeck.com/timriley/real-world-functional-ruby)**, Friday 6th October, 2017

## Resources

* [dry-rb documentation](http://dry-rb.org/)
* [dry-rb on GitHub](https://github.com/dry-rb)
* [rom-rb documentation](http://rom-rb.org/)
* [rom-rb on GitHub](https://github.com/rom-rb)
* [roda documentation](http://roda.jeremyevans.net)
* [roda on GitHub](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda)
* [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org)
* [Trailblazer](http://trailblazer.to)

rom-rb is very close to its 4.0 release right now, so if you'd like to explore it, please go ahead and install the release candidates: `gem install rom rom-sql --pre`.

## Open source examples

Check out [dry-rb/dry-web-blog](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-web-blog) for our work-in-progress example app using the dry-rb gems. We're developing this gradually, pull request by pull request, so watch the repository and you'll be able to follow along and even chime in if you have questions or thoughts.

For a slightly more developed app, you can also check out [icelab/berg](https://github.com/icelab/berg), which is the code behind the [Icelab company website](https://icelab.com.au). This one's a little bit stale now, but it should hopefully give you some ideas about how everything fits together.

## Further reading

Tim started a small blog series last year about “next-generation” Ruby apps, which explored how he started and explains in more detail some of the principles covered in the talk.

There are also others in the community who've been thinking and blogging about a functional approach to Ruby. A couple of good recent posts:

- [The Pure Function As An Object (PFAAO) Pattern](https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/the-pure-function-as-an-object-pfaao-pattern/), Tom Dalling
- [Refactoring From Inheritance To Composition To Data](https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/refactoring-inheritance-composition-data/), Tom Dalling
- [Embracing Functional Programming in Ruby](https://kellysutton.com/2017/09/13/embracing-functional-programming-in-ruby.html), Kelly Sutton
