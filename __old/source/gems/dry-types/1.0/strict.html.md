All types in the `strict` category are [constrained](/gems/dry-types/constraints) by a type-check that is applied to an input which makes sure that the input is an instance of the primitive:

``` ruby
Types::Strict::Integer[1] # => 1
Types::Strict::Integer['1'] # => raises Dry::Types::ConstraintError
```

Starting with 1.0 types imported by default are strict:

``` ruby
Types::Integer.eql?(Types::Strict::Integer) # => true
```
