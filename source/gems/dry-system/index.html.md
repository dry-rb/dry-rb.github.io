Object dependency management system based on [dry-container](/gems/dry-container) and [dry-auto_inject](/gems/dry-auto_inject) allowing you to configure reusable components in any environment, set up their load-paths, require needed files and instantiate objects automatically with the ability to have them injected as dependencies.

This library relies on very basic mechanisms provided by Ruby, specifically `require` and managing `$LOAD_PATH`. It doesn't use magic like automatic const resolution, it's pretty much the opposite and forces you to be explicit about dependencies in your applications.

It does a couple of things for you:

* Provides an abstract dependency container implementation
* Handles `$LOAD_PATH` configuration
* Loads needed files using `require`
* Resolves object dependencies automatically
* Supports auto-registration of dependencies via file/dir naming conventions
* Supports multi-system setups (ie your application is split into multiple sub-systems)

To put it all together, this allows you to configure your system in a way where you have full control over dependencies and it's very easy to draw the boundaries between individual components.

This comes with a bunch of nice benefits:

* Your system relies on abstractions rather than concrete classes and modules
* It helps in decoupling your code from 3rd party code
* It makes it possible to load components in complete isolation. In example you can run a single test for a single component and only required files will be loaded, or you can run a rake task and it will only load the things it needs.
* It opens up doors to better instrumentation and debugging tools

You can use `dry-system` in a new application or add it to an existing application. It should Just Workâ„¢ but if it doesn't please [report an issue](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/issues).

### Example

This library is the backbone of [dry-web](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-web), if you'd like to see a full-blown application example check out [Berg](https://github.com/icelab/berg). Please notice that `dry-system` is framework agnostic, in fact, it could be treated as a toolkit for building frameworks, as it provides facilities that are typically needed by frameworks.

### Rails support

There's no dedicated railtie for `dry-system` yet but we'd like to provide one at some point. Please [get in touch](https://gitter.im/dry-rb/chat) if you're interested in helping with this.

### Credits

* `dry-system` has been extracted from an experimental project called Rodakase created by [solnic](https://github.com/solnic). Later on Rodakase was renamed to [dry-web](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-web).
* System/Component and lifecycle triggers are inspired by Clojure's [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) library by [Stuart Sierra](https://github.com/stuartsierra)
