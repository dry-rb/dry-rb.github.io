      Fran is Technical Director and Co-Founder of [SafetyToolbox](http://safetytoolbox.co.uk).
      SafetyToolbox made the move to adopt [Trailblazer](http://trailblazer.to) last year and
      found the dry-rb community as part of that process. Fran is also a member of the
      Trailblazer core team so should be able to help those of you using dry gems with Trailblazer.
